# Quantum  
J2ME 3D Game engine based on Iceberg 3D.  

Uses software rendering and zone/portal-based culling.  
Supports some kind of scripting (should be replaced with lua!), has its own lightmapper.  
I wrote it when I was just learning Java and OOP, so the code quality is really low, but maybe this engine can be useful to someone.
